# MULTITHREAD-SPOTIFY-ACCOUNT-CHECKER-NO-PROXIES
I share with you a python spotify checker using selenium. You need the script.py, chromedriver.exe, and combo.txt to the repository. All the results will be save into the sub-repository "Results". For each test you run, an another repository will be create like "2020-02-10 21h45" where you will find result (Free.txt, Other.txt, Family member, Family Owner if accounts are detected)
