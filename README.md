### MULTITHREAD-SPOTIFY-ACCOUNT-CHECKER-NO-PROXIES

### DESCRIPTION
I share with you a python spotify checker using selenium. You need the script.py, chromedriver.exe, and combo.txt to the repository. All the results will be save into the sub-repository "Results". For each test you run, an another repository will be create like "2020-02-10 21h45" where you will find result (Free.txt, Other.txt, Family member, Family Owner if accounts are detected)

### REQUIERMENTS
```bash
You need to install selenium and chromedriver to use the following code. 

python -m pip install selenium
python -m pip install chromedriver


I recommand you to use ipython shell (with jupyter notebook for example) to not see all the command prompt generated by selenium.
If you encounter difficulties,try to install google chrome and chromedriver here with compatible version (chromedriver.exe need to be in the py script repository). 
```
